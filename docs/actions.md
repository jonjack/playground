Play _**actions **_are arguably one of the most fundamental features of the framework, and therefore of any Play application. They form the main boundary - for the developer in any case - between the web application code and the HTTP protocol. There is a considerable layer of code between the HTTP protocol server \(which is \[Netty\]\(http://netty.io/\) at the time of writing\) and the actions you write, but this is framework code which, for most applications, you will not to concern yourself with.
